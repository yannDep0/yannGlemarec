### Abstract

Many training or exposure therapy applications simulate audiences in virtual reality (VR) to provide safe and ecological environments. However, audience simulation in VR presents many challenges related to creating attitudes from the agents' non-verbal behaviour. Furthermore, in VR, the animations and the realism of the characters, also called agents, can also create performance problems. The behaviour models used in these systems are not directly evaluated in VR and rely on online studies or the application domain experts' knowledge. Thus, the difference in technology and the subjectivity of user perception could influence evaluation results. Therefore, we propose an audience behaviour model evaluated in VR that generates the non-verbal behaviours of its members from a given attitude to improve the audiences' quality and facilitate their use in educational and therapeutic scenarios. We present a series of performance and user perception evaluations in VR aiming at validating the system's ability to simulate different types of attitudes (bored, interested, or critical) while preserving an optimal VR experience and providing a high-level control application facilitating seamless attitude change in real-time, notably for the creation of training scenarios. Finally, we validate the deployment feasibility of this model in training and exposure therapy applications used by professionals.
