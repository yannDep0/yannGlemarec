## üí° About me

I am a associate professor at the University of Brest, France, in the INUIT team from the Lab-STICC. My main research topic is haptic technologies to augment users in immersive media. Therefore, I work on various perception studies and develop hardware prototypes. In parallel, I also investigate how to develop multimodal interactions with virtual agents to sustain collaboration in mixed reality.

## Projects

During my thesis, I worked on intelligent virtual agents and virtual reality simulation (see [STAGE project](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/virtual-reality/articles/10.3389/frvir.2022.876433/full)) for education and exposure therapy in virtual reality. Today, I am involved in a project exploring user augmentation with haptic technologies, such as strength perception in virtual reality through vibrotactile feedback or augmented narrative engagement through multimodal feedback.
